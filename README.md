# Flashcards-App
A simple app that reads a text file in the format ```term1&defenition2&term2&defenition2&```.
The app then puts this in an array split between ```&``` then cycles through finding the flashcards.
On top of this the app also allows the defenition to be displayed first by toggling a button in the side bar.
Another button in the sidebar allows the user to switch between the themes: Default (Blue/Green & White), Dark (Black & Grey).
