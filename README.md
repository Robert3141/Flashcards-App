# Flashcards-App
A simple app that reads a text file in the format ```term1&defenition1&term2&defenition2&```.
The app then puts this in an array split between ```&``` then cycles through finding the flashcards.
On top of this the app also allows the defenition to be displayed first by toggling a button in the settings activity.
Another button in the settings allows the user to switch between the themes: Default (Blue/Green & White), Dark (Black & Grey), Night (Black and Red).
As of version 4.0 you can now edit the flashcards in a seperate activity. Enjoy!
